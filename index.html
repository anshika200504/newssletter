            <h2>Can Rahul Gandhi the LoP be the Leader of the entire Opposition? A lot rests on that</h2>

            <p>Suddenly, Rahul Gandhi is the flavour of the season.
            If you look at the hard data, the BJP lost only 1.2% of 
            the popular vote share, and the Congress gained 1.49%. It is not as if whopping numbers swayed from one side to the other. The BJP still has 240 seats despite being in power for 10 years, the pre-poll alliance of the NDA has a clear majority, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has moved into his third term in office.This was not the case with the Congress-led UPA after its 10-year stint in power (2004-14). This time the Congress was lucky that the rise in its vote share translated into more seats, nearly doubling its number from 52 to 99.First, Gandhi has taken on the Leader of the Opposition (LoP) post and opted to lead the Congress from the front — unlike after earlier results. For 41 months, till Mallikarjun Kharge took over as the party chief in 2022, there was no full-time president of India’s Grand Old Party. It seemed to be waiting for Gandhi to make up his mind. After he stepped down as party president following the Congress’s 2019 debacle, Sonia Gandhi stepped into the breach as interim president. But behind the scenes, Rahul Gandhi continued to take all the major decisions.</p>
